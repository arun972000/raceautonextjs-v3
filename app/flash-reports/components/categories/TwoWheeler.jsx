                            In April 2025, Hero MotoCorp retained its position as the market leader with 5.11 lakh units sold, though its market share declined slightly to 30.34%, down from 31.06% in April 2024, indicating a marginal dip in dominance.

                            Honda Motorcycle recorded healthy year-on-year growth in both volume and market share, rising to 24.08% from 23.97%, fuelled by sustained demand for its scooter range.

                            TVS Motor posted notable gains, with its share increasing to 18.34% from 17.04%, reflecting consistent performance across both internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric vehicle (EV) segments.

                            Bajaj Auto experienced a decline in both volume and share, falling to 10.85% from 11.90%, possibly due to market headwinds or transition within its product line-up.

                            Both Suzuki and Royal Enfield improved their market positions, benefitting from strong brand loyalty and the successful launch of new models.

                            Among electric vehicle manufacturers, Ather Energy stood out with a sharp increase in market share from 0.25% to 0.78%, while Ola Electric, despite remaining the segment leader, saw its share fall from 2.07% to 1.17%.

                            The overall data reflects a stable ICE market with rising competition in the EV space, as new entrants gain traction and legacy OEMs adapt to evolving consumer preferences.
